This is the start of an export utility to export the CXF
confluence spaces to the sites.    To run this manually, you need to 
have a copy of the CXF website checked out to a local directory:

svn checkout https://svn.apache.org/repos/infra/websites/production/cxf/content

Build:
mvn install

You will need to pass credentials for a valid confluence user.  This can be
done in one of two ways:

1) Command line:
   -Dconfluence.user=username -Dconfluence.password=password

2) Profile in .m2/settings.xml
       <profile>
            <id>confluence</id>
            <properties>
                <confluence.user>user</confluence.user>
                <confluence.password>passwd</confluence.password>
            </properties>
        </profile>

To export the space:
mvn -Pconfluence exec:java -Dcxf.site.output=/path/to/content
should appear in /path/to/content/

In the confluence profile above, you could add a property like:
   <cxf.site.output>/path/to/content</cxf.site.output>
to simplify passing that into the command.

When you commit any changes in the content directory, the changes 
should be "live" fairly quickly due to the svnpubsub process.
