CVE-2014-3584: Apache CXF JAX-RS SAML handling is vulnerable to a Denial of
Service (DoS) attack

Severity: Major

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:

This vulnerability affects all versions of Apache CXF prior to 3.0.0-milestone1,
2.7.8 and 2.6.11.

Description:

An Apache CXF JAX-RS service can process SAML tokens received in the
authorization header of a request via the SamlHeaderInHandler. However it is
possible to cause an infinite loop in the parsing of this header by passing 
certain bad values for the header, leading to a Denial of Service attack on
the service.

This has been fixed in revision:

https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf?p=cxf.git;a=commit;h=0b3894f57388b9955f2c33b2295223f2835cd7b3

Migration:

CXF 2.6.x users should upgrade to 2.6.11 or later as soon as possible.
CXF 2.7.x users should upgrade to 2.7.8 or later as soon as possible.
CXF 3.0.x users should upgrade to 3.0.1 or later as soon as possible.
