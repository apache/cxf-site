CVE-2014-0109: HTML content posted to SOAP endpoint could cause OOM errors

Severity: Major

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:

This vulnerability affects all versions of Apache CXF prior to 2.6.14
and 2.7.11.

Description:

If content is posted to a SOAP endpoint with Content-Type text/html, CXF
creates an error message based on the input. This could potentially cause a
Out Of Memory (OOM) error on a large input, leading to a possible Denial of
Service attack.

This has been fixed in revisions:

https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf?p=cxf.git;a=commit;h=f8ed98e684c1a67a77ae8726db05a04a4978a445

Migration:

CXF 2.6.x users should upgrade to 2.6.14 or later as soon as possible.
CXF 2.7.x users should upgrade to 2.7.11 or later as soon as possible.
