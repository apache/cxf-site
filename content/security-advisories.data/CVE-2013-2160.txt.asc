CVE-2013-2160: Denial of Service Attacks on Apache CXF

Severity: Critical

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:

This vulnerability affects all versions of Apache CXF prior to 2.5.10, 2.6.7
and 2.7.4.

Description:

It is possible to execute Denial of Service attacks on Apache CXF, exploiting
the fact that the streaming XML parser does not put limits on things like the
number of elements, number of attributes, the nested structure of the document
received, etc. The effects of these attacks can vary from causing high CPU
usage, to causing the JVM to run out of memory.

Apache CXF 2.5.10, 2.6.7 and 2.7.4 onwards pick up Woodstox 4.2.0 as the
streaming XML parser, which enforces appropriate limits to prevent these
attacks.

This has been fixed in revisions:

http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1460428

Migration:

CXF 2.5.x users should upgrade to 2.5.10 or later as soon as possible.
CXF 2.6.x users should upgrade to 2.6.7 or later as soon as possible.
CXF 2.7.x users should upgrade to 2.7.4 or later as soon as possible.
