Severity: Major

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions Affected:

This vulnerability affects all versions of Apache CXF prior to 2.7.14 and
3.0.3.

Description:

Apache CXF is vulnerable to a possible SSL hostname verification bypass, due
to a flaw in comparing the server hostname to the domain name in the Subject's
DN field. A Man In The Middle attack can exploit this vulnerability by using
a specially crafted Subject DN to spoof a valid certificate.
