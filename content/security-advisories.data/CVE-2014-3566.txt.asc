Note on CVE-2014-3566 - SSL 3.0 support in Apache CXF, aka the "POODLE" attack:

The SSL protocol 3.0 uses non-deterministic CBC padding, which makes it easier
for man-in-the-middle attackers to obtain clear text data via a padding-oracle
attack, aka the "POODLE" issue: https://access.redhat.com/articles/1232123

The problem with POODLE comes when the connection is downgraded to use SSL 3.0
when higher level TLS comms fail. If an attacker in the middle of a connection
can cause this failure then they may be able to force the browser to do
exactly what it’s designed to do – fall back to SSL 3.0 and try again.

Apache CXF disables support for SSLv3 by default for both clients, as well as
Jetty servers configured via CXF's HTTPJ namespace, from the 3.0.3 and 2.7.14
releases. To support SSLv3 it is necessary to specify "SSLv3" for the
"secureSocketProtocol" attribute, see the tls configuration link below.
